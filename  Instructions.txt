This code aims to compute the data of neutron stars in General Relativity, Entangled Relativity, and Entangled Relativity with a retroaction of the scalar field on the equation of state. In it, we checked that the retroaction of the variation of ℏ has almost no impact.

To launch the code, download everything from the GitHub repository. Then, you need to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Then, in a terminal run :

" python3 Get_all_figures.py " 

This command will execute the code and generate a folder named save_hbar_NS. Inside, you will find matrices containing data for 1000 neutron stars, with energy densities ranging from 100 to 2000 MeV/fm³. You will also find three plots:

- Two showing the star mass as a function of radius, depending on their relative variation in ℏ. These correspond to values at the center of the star (scatter_1000.png) and at the surface (scatter_treshold_1000.png).
- A third figure, 'hbar_variation_comparison_NS.png', which illustrates the variation of ℏ as a function of the distance to the star, comparing the cases with and without retroaction.

These are the figures 3,4,5 of the paper available at hal-04996227.
The code works with precomputed data (stored in the matrices). If you want to run the calculations yourself, delete the folder that contains the data and launch the code as explained above.

The code runs for approximately twelve hours. However, it saves the computed data as it goes, so you don't need to rerun it to regenerate the figure. It also saves progress during execution — if the code is stopped after 2 hours, for example, you won’t lose those 2 hours of computation.
