This code aims to compute the value of Post-Newtonian parameters gamma and delta of neutron stars in Entangled Relativity by solving the modified TOV equations.

To launch the code, download everything from the GitHub repository. Then, you need to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Then, in a terminal run :

" python3 Get_all_figures.py " 

This command will execute the code and generate two figures. One for gamma-1 and one for delta-1 versus energy densities ranging from 100 to 1578 MeV/fmÂ³. 

These are the figures 1 and 2 of the paper ... . The code runs in less than a minutes.
