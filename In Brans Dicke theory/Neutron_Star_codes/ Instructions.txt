This code aims to compute the value of Post-Newtonian parameters gamma and delta of neutron stars in Brans-Dicke theory by solving the modified TOV equations.

To launch the code, download everything from the GitHub repository. Then, you need to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Then, in a terminal run :

" python3 Get_all_figures.py " 

This command will execute the code and generate 4 figures.
- Plot of 1-gamma exact for 150 different values of omega and of central densities
- Plot of the relative difference between the exact and standard post-Newtonian parameters gamma for 150 different values of omega and central densities.
- Plot of 1-delta exact for 150 different values of omega and of central densities
- Plot of the relative difference between the exact and standard post-Newtonian parameters delta for 150 different values of omega and central densities.

These are the figures 1,2,3 and 4 of the paper. The code runs in 4-5 hours.
